                It has been a real pleasure meeting you and working with you. We highly appreciate and treasure this experience.
                Your positive and zen energy with focused consistency at directing are truly admirable! It’s likely that Andrei 
                will consider doing his master degree in US later on. Hopefully you can guide us again?<br><br>

                I am so grateful for everything your amazing company have done for my son throughout this process. It’s been an 
                incredible thing to witness… Right at the beginning, he asked us nicely to stay out of it and we have been able to 
                ONLY because you – you have guided him and mentored him so beautifully. You have worked wonders in the face of 
                such a massive and thrilling choice of futures but which are only accessible via a complex and baffling system. 
                I am in awe of you all.<br><br>

                I just wanted to write to express my gratitude and my thanks as the decision to attend Stanford is certain. I was 
                thinking back at all the amazing work we did together: your amazing characters, understanding, honesty and compassion. 
                You not only helped me with this process but you also helped me discover things about me that I wasn’t even aware of. 
                Thank you so much for helping me in this journey!<br><br>
